Welcome! My name is Yukiko Irliyani. 

I am a Data Engineer and Data Science Enthusiast, just finished a Lead Data Engineer contract for [Xeratic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/xeratic/mycompany/) and currently residing in East Java. I studied at [Biomedical Engineering, Mahidol University](https://www.facebook.com/bmemahidol)

I love playing with data and visualization, especially when it comes to data for greater good. Besides data analytics, sometimes I do web design and digital illustrations. You can see my portofolio [here](/portofolio/), my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nmonarizqa), or my other writings on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nmonarizqa).

Let's keep in touch! Drop me a message at nmonarizqa [at] windowslive [dot] com. See you there :)
