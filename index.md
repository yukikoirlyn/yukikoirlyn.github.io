Welcome! My name is Yukiko Irliyani. 

I am a Data Engineer and Data Science Enthusiast, just finished a Lead Data Engineer contract for [Xeratic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/xeratic/mycompany/) and currently residing in East Java. I studied at [Biomedical Engineering, Mahidol University](https://www.facebook.com/bmemahidol)

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that's how I look at big-data sets to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me. You can see my portofolio [here](/portofolio/), my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yukikoirlyn/), or my other writings on [Medium](https://medium.com/@yukikoirlyn).

Do you want to work together? Drop me a message at irliyaniyukiko@gmail.com. See you there :)
