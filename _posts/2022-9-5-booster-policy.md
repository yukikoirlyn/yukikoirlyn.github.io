Effective booster vaccination is a travel requirement as of July 17, 2022. The requirements for booster vaccines are regulated in Circular Letter No. 70 of 2022 concerning instructions for the Implementation of Domestic Travel (PPDN) by air, land and sea transportation during the COVID-2019 pandemic.

Does the booster vaccine policy not affect people's mobility? Meanwhile, if the logic of each mobility growth means that it can affect economic growth? Or is it possible that the current public awareness is very high for vaccines?

To visualize the condition, I created a web view that analyzes several points: government policies and community mobility, Heat Maps of changes in community mobility by sector, the correlation between community mobility and Gross Domestic Product, and the correlation between vaccination increases and community mobility. I obtained the data through GOOGLE Community Mobility Report, Produk Domestik Bruto (PDB) menurut Lapangan Usaha by Badan Pusat Statistika (BPS), Total Vaccination by Our World in Data and visualize the data with Streamlit in python.
